This is the continuous build repository, with example configurations (and a basic 
one set up to run on CircleCI) to show how you can use repo2docker to build
a container that serves your notebook for others to use.

## Documentation

You will generally want to copy the `.circleci` folder and its contents to your own folder
with some corresponding notebook and requirements file. For complete documentation, please see 
[repo2docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy.html) 
on ReadTheDocs.
